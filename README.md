//radiation penetration demonstration using opengl glut

One of the most important aspects of wave property. This project demonstrates the wave nature of alpha rays, beta rays and gamma rays. It also deals with the penetration power of these waves depending upon their intensity and frequency of these waves. The penetration testing of these waves is done by using the objects such as paper, aluminium and lead. 
It uses GLUT
